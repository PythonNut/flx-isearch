;;; Commentary:

;; Fuzzy matching is awesome, when done right.

;; This program lets you isearch for "fiis" and be taken to matches for `flx-isearch-initialize-state'.
;; Searches currently only apply to symbols. The input string is flex matched to all symbols in the buffer,
;; and all matching symbols are searched one by one.

;; For example, searching for `fii` in `flx-isearch.el' first takes you to
;; * all instances of `flx-isearch-index' one by one
;; * all instances of `flx-isearch-initialize-state' one by one
;; * all instances of `flx-isearch-lazy-index' one by one
;; * [...]
;; * all instances of `bounds-of-thing-at-point' one by one

;; The _hope_ is that `flx' will be smart enough to quickly take you to the symbol you're thinking of with minimal effort.

;; Usage:

;; By default, `flx-isearch` does not bind any keys. `package.el' will
;; automatically setup the appropriate autoloads, and you can then do this:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s") #'flx-isearch-forward)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-r") #'flx-isearch-backward)
